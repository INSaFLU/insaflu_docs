Output Visualization and Download
=================================

Upon project's launching, you can start exploring the diverse INSaFLU outputs, which include project outputs 
(such as, alignments and phylogenetic trees) or sample-specific outputs (such as, mapping files, variants annotation and 
consensus sequences). Outputs are organized by the dynamic “expand-and-collapse” panels that allow you a user-friendly 
visualization/download of all graphical, text and sequence output data. The following table provides an overview on all 
INSaFLU outputs organized by bioinformatics module:
