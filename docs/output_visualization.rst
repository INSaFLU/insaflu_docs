Output Visualization and Download
=================================

Upon project's launching, you can start exploring the diverse INSaFLU outputs, which include **sample-specific outputs** (such as, mapping files, variants annotation and consensus sequences) or **project outputs** (such as, nucleotide/amino acid alignments and phylogenetic trees). Outputs are organized by the dynamic “expand-and-collapse” panels that allow you a user-friendly visualization/download of all graphical, text and sequence output data. The following table provides an overview on all INSaFLU outputs organized by bioinformatics module:

While navigating through INSaFLU menus, you will find which main software (including versions and settings) were used to generate outputs.
